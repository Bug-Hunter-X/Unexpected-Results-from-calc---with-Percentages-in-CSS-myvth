The solution is to ensure the parent element of the element using `calc()` has an explicitly defined width.  This could involve setting the parent's width in pixels, percentages (relative to its own parent), or using other CSS properties that provide a clear width.

For example:

```css
/* bug.css */
.parent {
  /* Missing width declaration - problem */
}

.child {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}

/* bugSolution.css */
.parent {
  width: 400px; /* Explicit width declaration - solution */
}

.child {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```
By giving the parent `.parent` a fixed width, the percentage calculation in `calc(50% - 10px)` will now be accurate.
